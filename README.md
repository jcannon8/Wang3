# TCR activation repositions Nck and Lck binding sites Supplementary information 
**Build** Files and scripts to build models  
makeTorsions.cpp: Write tleap impose statements based on HGBLE string.  
makeHGBLE.cpp : Output random HGBLE string based on sequence and frequency table.  
HGBLEfreq2: Secondary structure frequencies for IDR's.  
MakeEpsilon.sh: Create random CD3epsilon cytoplamsic domain models.  
makeCDed4.tcl: Make CD3 epsilon-delta dimers with random CTs fused to truncated subunits.  
thread2.tcl: Detect threading through Pro, Tyr, His, and Trp sidechains in edt models.

**Run** Job scripts to run MD of models  
tcr33minR.sh: Minimization of tcr33b,c,s and tcr35s on Rockfish.  
edt5min.sh: Minimization of edt.* on Rockfish  
edtNPT4.sh: Heat and two 500 ps NPT of edt models on Expanse  
edtNPT2.sh: continue 5 ns NPT of edt models on Rockfish 

**Examples** Eight TCR and TCR-GOF structures at 425 ns from figure 14.
